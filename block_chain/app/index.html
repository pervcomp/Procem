<h2>About this demo</h2>

<p>This demo was created in the
<a href="http://www.senecc.fi/projects/procem-2">Social Energy - Prosumer Centric Energy Ecosystem (ProCem)</a>
research project of
<a href="http://www.tut.fi/">Tampere University of Technology</a>.
Its purpose was to gain practical experience in working with blockchain technology and give the project group more concrete understanding about the technology. It is based on real time energy measurements from the university's
<a href="http://www.tut.fi/en/kampusareena/index.htm">Kampusareena</a>
building. It is based on  an imaginary scenario where the energy produced by Kampusareena's solar power plant is used locally only by the building's two elevators.
The demo then keeps a record of how much energy has been produced and consumed and shares it equally between the consumers. This record keeping happens every minute.</p>
